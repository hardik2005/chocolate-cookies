 • NOTE- When you are baking this cookie in summer, skip the milk since butter melts more in summer when whisked as compared to the winters. Use milk in the recipe in winters only.


1. Sieve flour, coco powder, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Mix and set aside.
2. Take another deep bowl and add butter, sugar and milk in it.
3. Whip it with electric whisk for about 2-3 minutes on high, till it becomes creamy and light.
4. Slowly add and mix the flour mixture to this butter mix and mix gently with a spoon or fork till all the ingredients are well combined into a dough.
5. Transfer this dough in a plastic bag or container and refrigerate it for at least ½ an hour. At this point, you may leave it in the refrigerator for longer time, till you are ready to bake.
6. Preheat the oven at 350*F or 180*C and Line a baking tray with parchment or butter paper.
7. Take the cold dough out. Divide it into 24 equal balls.
8. Take one ball and flatten it gently in your palm. Place on the baking sheet. Finish all the dough balls likewise. Place these flattened balls, 2 inches apart from each other. They spread out while baking.
9. Bake for 10 minutes for soft cookies and 12 minutes for slightly crispier coolies. Do not bake more than that.
10. Take the tray out of the oven and let the cookies sit there for 5 minutes and then transfer them carefully to the cooling rack.
11. They tasted awesome when they were warm but very soft to touch. They firmed up more once they cooled down to the room temperature.
